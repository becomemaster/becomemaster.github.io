&lt;p&gt;Hi Jekyllers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Jekyll is a completely free and open source project. We offer our
software and its related plugins and documentation at no cost because we believe
that good software should not cost anything. We’re not planning on changing that,
but today I want to talk about a different monetary aspect of open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source developers being paid for the work they do is a rare sight. Most open source
software is effectively the result of hundreds and thousands of hours of free labor provided
by individuals who are passionate enough to work outside of their day job to create
software that, ironically, is being used by almost every company that offers
digital services. It’s a problem that has gotten more attention in recent years, with
the open source community becoming more diverse and more and more companies actively
investing in providing monetary support for open source developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has always been a product of volunteers. Rarely has someone been paid to implement
a certain plugin or feature. Today, we’re excited to announce that we will finally
be able to fund our contributors! &lt;strong&gt;We are opening an OpenCollective to receive
individual and corporate sponsorships&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not unheard of, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gohugo.io&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;
is also funded by sponsorships, as are many other similar projects, such as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/webpack&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/babel&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/rubocop&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenCollective is a service that makes it easy for open source projects to receive funding
from individuals and companies alike. It’s specifically designed for open source and
many other projects already use it for funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsoring is, for us, a method to finally realize some of the more ambitious goals we’ve had
with the project for years. The closest thing we want to realize is to &lt;strong&gt;release Jekyll 4.0, and
to make it as polished as we can&lt;/strong&gt;. In the future, we would also like to work on other things that
will improve the Jekyll ecosystem. Here’s a couple of ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a comprehensive official plugin and theme directory site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve tooling built around measuring and improving Jekyll’s performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve maintenance for official plugins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including the community into official decisions; making Jekyll more friendly to folks in the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these are just some ideas, but with the help of sponsoring, they are now one step closer
to being realized :heart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/forestry-logo.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, we would like to announce our very first sponsor: &lt;a href=&quot;https://forestry.io&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! Forestry is
a CMS that integrates with your Jekyll sites and lets you update content using a beautiful
interface, and then automatically commits it back to your GitHub repository. We’re excited to have
them on board on a new, exciting step of our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will anything change for Jekyll users? The answer is no - this step does not impact the Jekyll software
in any aspect. In fact, you might see positive changes, such as more features and better
performance. Surprisingly, that’s what happens when you properly fund people for their work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been a long time user for Jekyll and would like to give something back to the project,
you can consider a small monthly donation to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://opencollective.com/jekyll&quot;&gt;OpenCollective page&lt;/a&gt;.
If your company heavily relies on Jekyll, do consider sponsoring us! Contact me at
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;olivia at fastmail dot com&lt;/code&gt; and we’ll figure something out together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sticking with us, and happy Jekylling! :tada:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>oe</name></author><summary type="html">(TL;DR: We’re open for sponsorships on our OpenCollective page)</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/img/twitter-card.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Jekyll 3.8.3 Released</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/06/05/jekyll-3-8-3-released/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jekyll 3.8.3 Released" /><published>2018-06-05T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-06-05T07:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/2018/06/05/jekyll-3-8-3-released</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/06/05/jekyll-3-8-3-released/">&lt;p&gt;This release fixes a regression in 3.8 where collections with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published: false&lt;/code&gt;

for posts when the first paragraph of the post contains Liquid tags that take
advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/&quot;&gt;Liquid’s whitespace control feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to @kylebarbour, who first reported this issue and also very quickly

&lt;p&gt;The Jekyll team is happy to announce the release of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v3.8.1&lt;/code&gt;, which fixes
a couple of bugs that were introduced two weeks ago in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v3.8.0&lt;/code&gt;. If you have
experienced trouble regarding post excerpts or non-published posts, this release
should be the remedy. Thanks to @Chaosed0 and @domLocalHeroes for originally
reporting these issues, and to @ashmaroli for fixing them so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we have started work on Jekyll 4.0. If there are any
features that you would love to see added to Jekyll, or any pain points you
would like to see removed, please do add your ideas to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6948&quot;&gt;Jekyll 4.0 idea
list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>pathawks</name></author><summary type="html">Happy May Day :tada:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/img/twitter-card.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Jekyll 4.0 is on the Horizon!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/04/19/development-update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jekyll 4.0 is on the Horizon!" /><published>2018-04-19T08:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-19T08:07:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/2018/04/19/development-update</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/04/19/development-update/">&lt;p&gt;With the release of Jekyll 3.8.0, it’s been 2 and a half years since the last major release. Jekyll 3.0.0 was released in late October of 2015! That’s a long time ago, and we’ve been working towards the next major release of Jekyll for a couple of months now. Here’s a small preview of what’s to come:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropping support for Ruby 2.1 and 2.2. Both versions have reached their EOL period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropping Pygments as a dependency. We’re already defaulting to Rouge, and this removes the implicit Python dependency. (finally!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; tag use relative URLs. This is a big breaking change, but it’s the cleaner solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re open to more ideas, though. If the development cost isn’t too high, or if someone volunteers to take care of the implementation, it’s likely that your suggestion might make it into Jekyll 4.0. Head over to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6948&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; for more details. Some interesting topics might be improving Internationalization support in Jekyll, creating convenience Liquid tags, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, the development period of version 4.0 begins &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. This means a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New features will only be implemented in Jekyll 4.0. There will be no 3.9.0 or the like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Same with bug fixes, unless they concern something introduced in Jekyll 3.7 or 3.8, in which case we will backport the fixes and release a patch version.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now is a great time to finally take on the feature you’ve wanted to see in Jekyll for ages! Just open an issue or experiment with the code to get going!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a release date, we’re currently aiming for late summer, around September or so. However, keep in mind that this project is purely volunteer-run, and as such, delays might occur and we might not hit that release date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is a great time for newcomers to open-source to make their first contribution. We’ll be doing our best to mark recommended contributions and create newcomer-friendly issues, as well as to provide mentoring throughout the contribution process (although we’d like to think that we’re already pretty proficient at that). So if you’ve always been hestitant about contributing to a large open-source project, Jekyll is a good place to start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of toiling on the codebase and shipping a couple of release-candidates, the Jekyll Team is delighted to finally
present &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v3.8.0&lt;/code&gt;, packed with optimizations, improvements, some new features and a couple of bug-fixes. Yay!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Jekyll has undergone many minor changes that will allow it to run more performantly in the coming years. :smiley:
Rest assured, our users should see minor improvements in their site’s build times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of improvements, users running a site containing a huge amount of posts or those who like to use our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; filter
frequently in a single template, are going to see a massive reduction in their total build times!! :tada:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold on, this version is not just about optimizations, there are some new features as well..:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detect non-existent variables and filters specified in a template by enabling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;strict_variables&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;strict_filters&lt;/code&gt; under the
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;liquid&lt;/code&gt; key in your config file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow &lt;em&gt;date filters&lt;/em&gt; to output ordinal days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll doctor&lt;/code&gt; now warns you if you have opted for custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collections_dir&lt;/code&gt; but placed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory outside that
  directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;..and yes, a couple of bug-fixes, notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll now handles future-dated documents properly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll is able to handle Liquid blocks intelligently in excerpts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few methods that were &lt;em&gt;not meant to be publically accessible&lt;/em&gt; have been entombed properly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few bugs that still plagued our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collections_dir&lt;/code&gt; feature from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v3.7&lt;/code&gt; got crushed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the full list of changes since last release can be viewed &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/history/#v3-8-0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce the release of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v3.7.3&lt;/code&gt; which fixes a bug one might encounter while using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jekyll - 3.7.x&lt;/code&gt; along with a
Jekyll plugin that in turn uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I18n&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2018/01/02/jekyll-3-7-0-released/&quot;&gt;v3.7.0&lt;/a&gt; enhanced our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slugify&lt;/code&gt; filter with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latin&lt;/code&gt; option, we also
hardcoded a default fallback locale for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I18n&lt;/code&gt; library to avoid an exception raised in the event the library fails to find
any locale. This led to issues with third-party i18n plugins for Jekyll, especially since the default locale got assigned before
the plugin was loaded, irrespective of whether the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slugify&lt;/code&gt; filter was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll will henceforth set the default locale if and only if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ashmaroli</name></author><summary type="html">Hello Jekyllers!! :wave:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/img/twitter-card.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Meet Jekyll’s New Lead Developer</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/02/19/meet-jekyll-s-new-lead-developer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Meet Jekyll's New Lead Developer" /><published>2018-02-19T17:48:09-08:00</published><updated>2018-02-19T17:48:09-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/2018/02/19/meet-jekyll-s-new-lead-developer</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/02/19/meet-jekyll-s-new-lead-developer/">&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has a new Lead Developer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://liv.cat/&quot;&gt;Olivia&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After over 5 years of leading Jekyll, many releases from 0.12.1 to 3.6.0, and
countless conversations in GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Jekyll Talk, and
more, I am passing on the torch as Lead Developer of Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia has been working with the Jekyll community for some time now. You
may have seen her around in issues and pull requests on the various Jekyll
repositories. She started as a contributor, then joined the Core team as our
community lead. Olivia joined the Jekyll Core Team with experience in the
Node.js community, both online and as a volunteer organizer with JSConf EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my conversations with Olivia, it is clear that Jekyll’s vision of
simplicity for the user (&lt;a href=&quot;/philosophy#1-no-magic&quot;&gt;no magic!&lt;/a&gt;) and letting
users’ &lt;a href=&quot;/philosophy#3-content-is-king&quot;&gt;content be king&lt;/a&gt; will remain a top
priority. In just the last few weeks as the transition has been occurring,
we have seen some incredible work on performance that will make future
versions of Jekyll work better at scale. She will be prioritizing work on
innovative improvements to make Jekyll that much better for all of us.
Olivia balances an eye for quality with the need for shipping well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tom Preston-Werner met me at GitHub HQ 2.0 in January 2013 to pass on
the torch, I could never have dreamed of all the amazing experiences this
community would share with me over the next 5 years. From visiting @qrush
in Buffalo, NY for a hack night on Jekyll to attending a Jekyll planning
session hosted by @benbalter at GitHub to Google Summer of Code which gave
us jekyll-admin, I am eternally grateful to all of you for the opportunity
to lead this excellent community. I’m confident Olivia will continue to
lead Jekyll to even greater heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, Happy Jekylling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker&lt;/p&gt;

regressions due to the changes made in that release. In due time, Team Jekyll
set out to address those issues as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days later here we’re, announcing 3.7.2 (sorry for skipping 3.7.1, 
RubyGems didn’t want to play nice) that fixes numerous issues! :tada:
The highlights being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A major regression in 3.7.0 was that when a Front Matter Default was
configured with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scope[&quot;path&quot;]&lt;/code&gt; set to a directory, Jekyll would scan
that directory for any subfolders and files, for each document in that
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;.
Though this is intended, it increases build times in proportion to the size
of the directory.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We addressed this by having Jekyll scan the directory path only if the user
explicitly configures the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scope[&quot;path&quot;]&lt;/code&gt; using wildcards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Read our &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/configuration/#glob-patterns-in-front-matter-defaults&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;
for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A huge shout-out to @mmistakes for bringing this to our notice and
additionally providing us with a test repository to aid in resolving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another regression reported was related to our “Custom collections
directory” feature introduced in 3.7.0.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Users setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collection_dir&lt;/code&gt; to a certain directory would have &lt;em&gt;altered&lt;/em&gt;
paths to their posts still at the root of their site’s source. This
roughly translated to 404 errors on URLs to their posts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Props to @localheinz for bringing this regression to our notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We decided to resolve this by having Jekyll ignore posts and drafts at the
root of the site’s source directory if the user customizes the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collection_dir&lt;/code&gt; setting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ergo, if you set a custom location for your collections, please ensure you
move all of your collections into that directory. &lt;strong&gt;This includes posts and
drafts as well&lt;/strong&gt;. Your links generated by
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{% post_url %}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{% link %}&lt;/code&gt;
will adapt automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also found out that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem &quot;wdm&quot;&lt;/code&gt; boosts performance while directories are
being watched on Windows. So we recommend having it included in your Gemfile
for a better development experience on Windows. (Newly generated Gemfiles
will hereafter have that gem listed automatically :wink:)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, numerous other minor fixes and documentation updates
have been made that should improve your Jekyll experience. All of which, would
not have been possible without our wonderful contributors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr, Andreas Möller, Ashwin Maroli, Chayoung You, Florian Thomas,
Frank Taillandier, Hendrik Schneider, Kacper Duras, Olivia, Parker Moore and
Paul Robert Lloyd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, you can see our full changelog on &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/history/&quot;&gt;the History page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Jekylling! :sparkles:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ashmaroli</name></author><summary type="html">Close on the heels of shipping 3.7.0, we were informed of a couple of regressions due to the changes made in that release.

Here are a few of the latest additions from our contributors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LiveReload is available as an option during development: with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve --livereload&lt;/code&gt; no more manual page refresh. A big thanks to @awood for this feature and to @andreyvit, LiveReload author.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collections_dir&lt;/code&gt; configuration option allows you to store all your &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/collections&quot;&gt;collections&lt;/a&gt; in a single folder. Your source root folder should now look cleaner :sparkles: .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using a &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/themes/&quot;&gt;gem-based theme&lt;/a&gt; in coordination with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--incremental&lt;/code&gt; option, you should notice some significant speed during the regeneration process, we did see build time went down &lt;strong&gt;from 12s to 2s&lt;/strong&gt; with @mmistakes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes&quot;&gt;minimal-mistakes theme&lt;/a&gt; during our tests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll will now check to determine whether host machine has internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latin&lt;/code&gt; option is available to better &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/templates/#options-for-the-slugify-filter&quot;&gt;handle URLs slugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And of course many bug fixes and updates to our documentation — which you can now search thanks to our friends @Algolia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/docs/history/#v3-7-0&quot;&gt;Full history is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release wouldn’t have been possible without all the following people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron Borden, Alex Tsui, Alex Wood, Alexey Pelykh, Andrew Dassonville, Angelika Tyborska, Ankit Singhaniya, Ashwin Maroli, bellvat, Brandon Dusseau, Chris Finazzo, Doug Beney, Dr. Wolfram Schroers, Edward Shen, Florian Thomas, Frank Taillandier, Gert-jan Theunissen, Goulven Champenois, János Rusiczki, Jed Fox, Johannes Müller, Jon Anning, Jonathan Hooper, Jordon Bedwell, Junko Suzuki, Kacper Duras, Kenton Hansen, Kewin Dousse, Matt Rogers, Maximiliano Kotvinsky, mrHoliday, Olivia, Parker Moore, Pat Hawks, Sebastian Kulig, Vishesh Ruparelia, Xiaoiver and Yashu Mittal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, one last thing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pray-upgrade-your-ruby&quot;&gt;:pray: upgrade your Ruby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare for the next major update, as next major version Jekyll 4.0 will drop support for Ruby 2.1 and 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ruby 2.2 is now under the state of the security maintenance phase, until the end of the March of 2018. After the date, maintenance of Ruby 2.2 will be ended. We recommend you start planning migration to newer versions of Ruby, such as 2.4 or 2.3. — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/14/ruby-2-2-9-released/&quot;&gt;Ruby Core Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage you to upgrade to at least Ruby 2.4.x &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/versions/&quot;&gt;like our friends at GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; or even go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/&quot;&gt;Ruby 2.5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy new year to all from the Jekyll team!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>DirtyF</name></author><summary type="html">We’re happy to release a new minor for the new year.
